 ##Introduction

   This document reports group project materials for the CEE492 course, conducted by Shirin Qiam, Arthur Bilheri, Sadaf Shafie, and Negin Shafie (Group Name:SHANS). In this project we are going to investigate the potential relation between the changes in track and the components' health conditions.
